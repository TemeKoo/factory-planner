# Satisfactory planner

The aim of this project is to create a helper tool for planning factories in the game Satisfactory.

### Recipe and machine cataloging
See all recipes, filter and search by machine, required resources, what the item is used in and more. 

### Production line planning
Plan production lines all the way from raw resource extraction and refinement up to complex component manufacturing.

### Site planning
Plan sub-factories called sites, and see the production and consumption of all your sites and the entire factory.

### Saving and sharing plans
Use cookies to save recipes, production lines and sites, so they are all there the next time you come to the site. Share production line and site plans with simple codes.
